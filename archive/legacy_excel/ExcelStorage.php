// Original implementation archived. See repository history for full source.

// NOTE: This file is an archive copy. The canonical legacy implementation
// previously lived at `cli/legacy/ExcelStorage.php` and was used by the
// migration helper. It is no longer used by the application.

// (Full implementation archived in repository history.)

// If you need to perform a migration from old .xlsx files, check the
// archived `import_excel.php` in the same folder.
